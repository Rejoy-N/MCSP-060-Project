\section{Introduction}
Electronic commerce commonly written as E-commerce or ecommerce is the trading or facilitation of trading using computer networks such as Internet or Social Networks. Electronic Commerce draws on technologies such as mobile commerce, electronics funds transfer, supply chain management, Internet Marketing, Online Transaction Processing, Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), inventory management systems and automated data collection systems. Modern electronic commerce typically uses the world wide web for atleast one part of the transaction's life cycle although it may also use other technologies like email.
\\

Online Shopping is a from of electronic commerce which allows consumers to directly buy good or services from a seller over the internet using a web browser. Consumers find a product of interest by visiting the website of the retailer directly or by searching among alternative vendors using a shopping search engine which displays the same product's availablity and pricing at different vendors. Customers can shop online using a range of different computers and devices including desktop computers, laptops, tablet computers and smartphones.
\\

In this synopsis high-level details of implementation of a Online Mobile Store will be provided.
\bigskip

\newpage


\subsection{Background}
An online shop evokes the physical analogy of buying products and services at a regular "bricks-and-mortar" retailer or shopping center; the process is called business-to-consumer (B2C) obline shopping.A typical online store enables the customer to browse the firm's range of products and services, view photos or images of the products, along with information about the product specifications, features and prices
\\

Online stores typically enable shoppers to use "search" features to find specific models, brands or items. Online customers must have access to the Internet and a valid method of payment in order to complete a transaction, such as a credit card, an Interac-enabled debit card, or a service such as PayPal. For physical products (e.g., paperback books or clothes), the e-tailer ships the products to the customer; for digital products, such as digital audio files of songs or software, the e-tailer typically sends the file to the customer over the Internet. The largest of these online retailing corporations are Alibaba, Amazon.com, and eBay
\\

English entrepreneur Michael Aldrich was a pioneer of online shopping in 1979. His system connected a modified domestic TV to a real-time transaction processing computer via a domestic telephone line.The first World Wide Web server and browser, created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990, opened for commercial use in 1991.Thereafter, subsequent technological innovations emerged in 1994: online banking, the opening of an online pizza shop by Pizza Hut, Netscape's SSL v2 encryption standard for secure data transfer, and Intershop's first online shopping system. The first secure retail transaction over the Web was either by NetMarket or Internet Shopping Network in 1994.Immediately after, Amazon.com launched its online shopping site in 1995 and eBay was also introduced in 1995. Alibaba's sites Taobao and Tmall were launched in 2003 and 2008, respectively.
\\

Mobile Phone online buying platforms can be braodly classified into 2 types

\ListProperties(Hide=100, Hang=true, Progressive=6ex, Space=0.8em,Space*=0.8em, Style*=$\bullet$, Style2*=$\bullet$ ,Style3*=$\bullet$ ,Style4*=\tiny$\blacksquare$ )

\subsection{Preliminary Product Description}
A VM Load Balancing Algorithm is selected and then implemented in Cloud Computing
environment using CloudSim toolkit, in java language. 
\\

In this algorithm, the VM assigns a varying (different) amount of the available processing power to the individual application services. These VMs are of different processing powers. The tasks/requests (application services) are assigned or allocated to the most powerful VM and then to the lowest and so on.
\\

Hence the given performance parameters such as response time and data processing time can be optimised, giving an efficient VM Load Balancing algorithm i.e. ‘Weighted Active Load Balancing Algorithm’ in the Cloud Computing environment.
\bigskip

\subsection{Conceptual Models}

\caption{Multi-Layer Design of CloudSim Framework}
\label{fig:1}
\end{figure}

Figure 1 shows the multilayer design of the cloudsim software framework and its architectural components. First layer is a simulation engine that supports several core functionalities, such as queuing and processing of events, creation of Cloud system entities (services, host, data center, broker, and virtual machines), communication between components, and management of the simulation clock. The CloudSim simulation layer provides support for modeling and simulation of virtualized Cloud-based data center environments including dedicated management interfaces for virtual machines (VMs), memory, storage, and bandwidth. The fundamental issues such as provisioning of hosts to VMs, managing application execution, and monitoring dynamic system state are handled by this layer. The top-most layer in the CloudSim stack is the User Code that exposes basic entities for hosts (number of machines, their specification and so on), applications (number of tasks and their requirements), VMs, number of users and their application types, and broker scheduling policies.

\caption{Class Diagram of CloudSim -2}
\label{fig:3}
\end{figure}

Figure 2 \& 3 indicate the class diagram of CloudSim. These classes are building blocks of creating cloud applications and services. The existing classes and interfaces can be extended for experimenting and research solutions. Risk associated with the change of policy and technology is greatly simplified with simulation step with the cloudsim. Challenging and risk
oriented applications of cloud computing can be formulated and tested with the cloud environment provided by the cloudsim toolkit. The simulation and modeling environment provided by this is greatly helpful for the organizations seeking change with respect to the existing cloud services. Researchers can simulate and verify their research problem and accordingly take the corrective steps, if some issues remain unresolved.
