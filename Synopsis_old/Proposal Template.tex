	\section[Project Management]{Project Management Methodology and Technique}
	
	To achieve the business objectives within the defined parameters of time, budget and quality it is important to have a professional discipline that combines systems, techniques and people. This discipline should employ a creative problem solving processes designed to recognize and solve problems as they arise and also to proactively anticipate and avert potentially detrimental situations.
	
	\subsection{Factors}
	
	\begin{easylist}
		& \thinspace Product development Timeline
		& \thinspace Change in requirements at development stages
		& \thinspace Early involvement of stakeholders and feedback
		& \thinspace Measure and control of work effort
		& \thinspace Cross-functional team 
		& \thinspace Mitigate risk of deviation from the required functionality of the application system
		
	\end{easylist}
			
	\subsection{Selected Approach}

	\begin{easylist}
		& \thinspace Scrum methodology, will provide more realistic insight on the project progress and the outcome of the product itself at the end of every Sprint that are planned at short intervals. This provides an opportunity to the Product owner and the stakeholders to change the course of the priorities of the product as needed based on the timeline of the project.

		& \thinspace Adopting Scrum, we set the objectives at the beginning of each sprint. It is the team’s responsibility to determine how to best meet those objectives. At the end of a sprint, working code will be demonstrated, so the progress made can be seen.

	The proposed framework encapsulates the key focus areas that formulate the methodology ensuring the success of the project. The key focus areas will be
	
	\begin{easylist}
	& \thinspace Inception inputs
	& \thinspace Artifacts
	& \thinspace Process
	& \thinspace Roles (team composition)
	\end{easylist}
	
	\subsection{Inception Inputs}
	
	\subsection{Roles}
	Project team proposed by Thrymr will be a cross-functional team with experience from different functional areas. This section lists the key roles within the framework and the corresponding functions and responsibilities.
	
	\subsubsectionfont{\color{levelfirst}}
	\subsubsection{Product Owner}
	The Product Owner is responsible for ensuring that the functionality that is prioritized, developed and implemented meets the needs of the business and derives business benefits particularly in terms of return on investment. Following are the key functions that would be performed by the Product Owner.
	
	\begin{easylist}
		& \thinspace Creates and Maintains the Product Backlog.
		& \thinspace Prioritizes and sequences the Backlog according to business value and the product release plan.
		& \thinspace Assists with the elaboration of Epics, Themes and Features into user stories those are granular enough to be achieved in a single sprint. User Stories will be elaborated at the last responsible moment and the Product Owner will help the teams to understand exactly what is required.
		& \thinspace Conveys the Vision and Goals at the beginning of every Release and Sprint.
		& \thinspace Represents the Bureaus, interfaces and engages the user.
		& \thinspace Participates in the daily Scrums, Sprint Planning Meetings and Sprint Reviews and Retrospectives.
		& \thinspace Inspects the product progress at the end of every Sprint.
		& \thinspace Communicates status externally.
		
	\end{easylist}
	
	\subsubsection{Scrum Master}
	The ScrumMaster serves as a facilitator for both the Product Owner and the Project Team. The Scrum Master work towards to remove any impediment, within or external to the team that prevents them reaching their goal of building the functionality they commit at the beginning of each Sprint. The following will serve as guiding principles for the Scrum Master.
		
		\begin{easylist}
			& \thinspace Be a team player
			& \thinspace Remove impediments
			& \thinspace Radiate information
			& \thinspace Support the Product Owner
			& \thinspace Facilitate creativity and empowerment for the development team
			& \thinspace Improve the team’s engineering practices and tools as needed
			& \thinspace Communicate with all stakeholders 
		\end{easylist}\par
	\bigskip
	\noindent
	In addition to leading the daily scrum meetings and the sprint planning meetings the ScrumMaster owns the following responsibilities.
	
		\begin{easylist}
			& \thinspace The ScrumMaster will keep abreast with the tasks that have been completed, tasks that have started, any new tasks that have been discovered, and any estimates that may have changed. These inputs will be used to update the Burndown chart showing the cumulative work remaining day by day.
			& \thinspace The ScrumMaster will proactively look for the dependencies and blocks that are impediments to the sprint, and prioritize the same. Scrum Master will develop a remediation plan for the impediments in priority order.
		\end{easylist}\
		
	\subsection{Project Team}
	Each Scrum Team member will be empowered to self-manage and be responsible to turn action items on the Product Backlog into functional pieces of the final system product. The composition of the team will be with multiple specialties - quality control, programming, business analysis, etc. Teams will be organized into a manageable size that enables the effective communication within the team and Scrum meetings are kept to minimum time.
	
	\subsection{Artifacts}
	Documentation and its transparency between the business analysts and the project development team is very critical. There is emphasis to make sure the project team understands the documented product requirements.
	
	\subsubsection{Product Backlog}
	Product Backlog is a prioritized list of requirements with estimated times to turn them into completed product functionality. Priority will be assigned based on the items of most value to the business. Product backlog items can be
	
	\begin{easylist}
		& \thinspace Functional requirements
		& \thinspace Non-functional requirements
		& \thinspace Issues or defects from earlier Sprints.
	\end{easylist}	

	\subsubsection{Sprint Backlog}
	The Sprint backlog is a list of tasks that defines a Team's work for a Sprint. The tasks on the Sprint backlog are what the Team has defined as being required to turn committed Product Backlog items into system functionality. Each task identifies who is responsible for doing the work and the estimated amount of work remaining on the task on any given day during the Sprint.

	\subsubsection{Impediment List}
	Scrum Master will keep a tab on all the issues around the project that impedes its productivity and quality, via Impediment list. Scrum Master will own the responsibility to remove any impediment that is stopping the team from producing production quality code.
	
	\subsubsection{Product Backlog Composition Report}
	The Product Backlog Composition report shows the Product Backlog Items in the context of the Release Plan and how they relate to Sprint Tasks. This report will be useful to locate Sprint Task not allocated to a Sprint or associated with a linked Product Backlog item for which it is contributing part of its implementation.
	
	\subsection{Process}
	Sprint starts off with the Product Owner ensuring the prioritized and up-to-date Product Backlog is available. The team selects an achievable set of the highest priority backlog and work out how to build it in the Sprint Planning meeting. The team then proceeds to work through the Sprint Backlog tasks on a daily basis, synchronizing their activity in a daily Scrum Meeting. At the end of the Sprint the team will have a build Product Increment which will be demonstrated to the Product Owner, business users and other interested stakeholders in the Sprint Review Meeting. Feedback from the Sprint Review will be added to the Product Backlog and prioritized by the Product Owner. Before starting the next Sprint the team discusses the performance and makes improvements in the way they work in the Sprint Retrospective.
	
	\subsection{Quality Assurance Management Methodology}
	Quality Assurance Management Methodology will provide a planned and systematic approach to the evaluation of the quality of the product and adherence to the standards, processes, and procedures. Compliance with agreed-upon standards and procedures will be evaluated through	
	
	\begin{easylist}
		& \thinspace Monitoring
		& \thinspace Evaluation
		& \thinspace Audits or reviews (Verification and Validation)
	\end{easylist}\par
	\bigskip
	\noindent
	The processes will include quality assurance approval points, where a QA evaluation of the deliverable will be done in relation to the applicable standards. The first task in setting up the quality assurance team will be establishing the standards and procedures for the product development.
	
	\newpage
	
	\section{Project Assumptions}

    \section{Risk Management}
    
    \subsection{Purpose of the Risk Management Plan}
    The Risk Management Plan defines how risks associated with the  project will be identified, analyzed, and managed. It outlines how risk management activities will be performed, recorded, and monitored throughout the lifecycle of the project and provides templates and practices for recording and prioritizing risks.\\ \\
    The Risk Management Plan is created by the project manager in the Planning Phase and is monitored and updated throughout the project.
    
    \subsection{Risk Management Procedure}
    
    \subsubsection{Process}
    The project manager working with the project team and project sponsors will ensure that risks are actively identified, analyzed, and managed throughout the life of the project.  Risks will be identified as early as possible in the project so as to minimize their impact. 
    
    \subsubsection{Risk Identification}
    All risks identified will be assessed to identify the range of possible project outcomes.  Qualification will be used to determine which risks are the top risks to pursue and respond to and which risks can be ignored.
    
    \subsubsection{Risk Response Planning}
    Each major risk will be assigned to a project team member for monitoring purposes to ensure that the risk will not materialize. \\ \\
    For each major risk, one of the following approaches will be selected to address it:
    \begin{easylist}
    	& \thinspace Avoid – eliminate the threat by eliminating the cause
    	& \thinspace  Mitigate – Identify ways to reduce the probability or the impact of the risk
    	& \thinspace Accept – Nothing will be done
    \end{easylist}\par
    \bigskip
    \noindent
    For each risk that will be mitigated, the project team will identify ways to prevent the risk from occurring or reduce its impact or probability of occurring.  This may include prototyping, adding tasks to the project schedule, adding resources, etc.\\ \\
    For each major risk that is to be mitigated or that is accepted, a course of action will be outlined for the event that the risk does materialize in order to minimize its impact.
    
    \subsubsection{Risk Monitoring, Controlling and Reporting}
    The level of risk on a project will be tracked, monitored and reported throughout the project lifecycle.  \\ 
    A “Top 10 Risk List” will be maintained by the project team and will be reported as a component of the project status reporting process for this project.  \\ 
    All project change requests will be analyzed for their possible impact to the project risks.\\
    
    \subsubsection{Tools and Practises}
    A Risk Log will be maintained by the project manager and will be reviewed as a standing agenda item for project team meetings.
    \newpage
    
    \section{Change Management Process}
